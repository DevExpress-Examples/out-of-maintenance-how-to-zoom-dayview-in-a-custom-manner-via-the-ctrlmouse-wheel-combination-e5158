# How to zoom DayView in a custom manner via the CTRL+MOUSE WHEEL combination


<p>This example illustrates how to substitute the MouseHandlerService service for extending the standard zooming feature. To accomplish this task, you need to create a custom MouseHandlerServiceWrapper class and override its OnMouseWheel method.
